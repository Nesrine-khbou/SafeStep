## <a name="description">Description</a>

This mobile application is called SafeStep, developed in React Native as part of an IoT solution for a smart crutch.
this app includes :

Authentication (Sign-up, Sign-in, Sign-out): The sign-up process involves sending a verification code via email.

Home Page: This page displays the current location of the crutch on Google Maps, as well as its recent locations with their coordinates.

Data Page: It shows information related to LED activation, object proximity, and fall detection in the form of time-series graphs.

Battery Status Page: This page displays the crutch's battery status (low, good, full / charging, not charging).

Profile Page: It shows the user's information.

In the continuous integration part, I also developed some unit tests for the mobile app, which have been integrated into a continuous integration pipeline using Jenkins.
